<div style="text-indent:2em">
  In our EE396 project, my team proposed, designed and developed an Android app that manages their subscriptions of users.
The app lists subscriptions, synchronizes subscription payments with Google Calendar, and keeps track of total payments.
Compared to the other apps in Play Store, it can add the subscriptions into Google Calendar.
</div>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
  The main screen of this app lists all the subscriptions and sums up the total monthly cost. User can enter subscriptions in the secondary screen. We created this app with Android Studio, and we also used the SQLite library and Google Calendar API.
All the subscriptions are shown in a ListView, and the monthly payment is shown in the right corner. 
</div>
