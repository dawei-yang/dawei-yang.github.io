  	I am a PC gamer, and I want to make my own wonderful game someday. That is the reason I switch my major to Computer Engineering. I didn’t like programming before. I still remember my first programming course in other university when I majored Mechanical Engineering. It was like a nightmare to me since I didn’t know what I should do, and I just memorized some sample codes for the exams. When studying Electrical Engineering at UHM, I had to learn C again. At the beginning, it was still hard for me, and I needed spending lots of time to do homeworks and watch tutorials. The thing got me into programming was one assignment that we needed to write our first Game, Snake, in C. It is easy to do that with Unity, but it was very hard to a beginner of C. I spent most of my time in the lab. Finally, that game could run although it was buggy. I was the first time that I found programming was amazing.

  	So far, I have learned many programming courses in CENG such as cyber security and operating system, but I like game development most. Of course, I don't use C to write games anymore. High level language and Unity, which is a great game engine, help me develop games easily and fast. The skills and experiences I want to develop in future are Unity and C#. There are many useful features that I don’t know, and those features may ?

	The other thing I need to improve is math. When I am writting a game, the most difficult part is to implement the move method of game objects. For example, when I design the movement of an enemy of a 2D flying game, I need to use sin of cos function to make the movement more complicated.
