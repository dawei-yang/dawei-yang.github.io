<h2>Introduction  </h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
 UI frameworks provide a huge number of build-in classes in order to simplify the works of developers. In my opinion, the relationship between raw HTML + CSS and UI frameworks  is similar to programming languages and libraries. For example, if we need to sort an array, we can spend one hour to implement a quick sort function, or we can use a quick sort library which is implemented and tested by other people. Obvious, most of us will choose the second option except those who are taking algorithm course. However, if the quick sort is a special version, we still need use base programming language to modify the function. 
UI frameworks make the process of development faster and easier, but they have constraints. Therefore we need raw HTML and CSS.  In the rest of this essay, I will discuss pros and cons of UI frameworks.

<h2>Advantages  </h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
		UI Frameworks speedup our approaches. In the past two weeks, I tried to use Semantic UI to recreate some websites such as Islandsnow and Dell.	 Compared to the experience before we were introduced to Semantic UI, I spent less time but create more complicated stuffs. It is also good for demonstrating our ideas and concepts just like brainstorming because we can only use half an hour to build a simply version by using UI frameworks.

	Our codes become much shorter after using UI frameworks. For example, we have to divide the screen and make four blocks if we want to create four equal menu items. On the other hand, we only need a ‘four column grid’ class to approach this by using Semantic UI. As a result, the syntax of UI frameworks are much closer to natural language.

 By using UI frameworks, we can enhance the readability of our scripts.

<h2>Disadvantage  </h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">  
	Although UI frameworks have many options for every elements, users cannot get fully control of the codes. For example, Semantic UI allows us use keywords ‘right’ or ‘left’ place an item, but we don’t know which part of right or left the item will be allocated until we run the script on Chrome. Moreover, if we want to place an element at a specific place, we still need raw CSS to control it. This is similar to C and Javascript. Javascript has garbage collection feature that manages the usage of memory, which is convenient to users. We know the useless memory will be reuse, but we don’t know how and when the interpreter does this. If we want to free a block of memory at specific time, C is the language we needed.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">  
	Even though UI frameworks sometimes are limited and not flexible, it reduces many works. Our codes become shorter and more readable, and we can spend more time in developing our web pages rather than repeating the same process. While the UI frameworks can simplify the process of development, raw HTML and CSS are still useful since they provide the fully control of our scripts. I think we should use UI frameworks to approach our designs as the first step. Then, we can use raw HTML and CSS to adjust our designs.
