<h2>Introduction  </h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
As a result of the growth of the internet, people can easily ask questions on internet forum.  However, 
asking question in “smart way” is still important. According to Raymond’s essay <i>How To Ask Questions The
Smart Way</i>, there are many benefits if we ask smartly: we can learn more from the processes that we
prepare to ask questions; we can receive more correct answers related to those problems; we can receive
answers or suggestions faster. 
</div>
<h2>Strategy  </h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
Raymond suggests some strategies that we can do in order to ask question in the smart way. First
  strategy is to do some search before ask. On the one hand, it proves to the people who can solve
  those problems that  we have tried our best and we are not lazy. On the other hand, what we learn
  from doing search gives more information to people who want to help.
Second, we should choose suitable forum. For example, I should ask a algorithm question in Stack Overflow 
or GeedsforGeeks rather than Android Developer forum.   
Third, using meaningful and clear language to ask as many people as we can. Raymond suggests that we 
should ask the whole group instead individual developers. Moreover, we should make our statement as clear
as possible and only show the codes that are related to our questions.

<h2>Example of the "smart way"  </h2>
<h3>C - strtok give back less data  </h3>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
First, he used a specific header with tag, so people could know what kind of question it is immediately. 
Then he described his goal and showed his code along with a test case. I think he provided enough information
to other people to answer this question. 
</div>
<h3>Result  </h3>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
He received the corrected answer very fast, and people would like to help him since he showed his efforts.
</div>

<h2>Example of the “not smart way” </h2>
<h3>How to split array in Javascript </h3>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
	He just asked how to split a string <div>"AK, BK, CC, CS, DH, GR, KZ, MS, OD, YU " into </div> 
	<div>'AK', 'BK', 'CC', 'CS', 'DH', 'GR', 'KZ', 'MS', 'OD', 'YU'</div>
</div>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
Based on Raymond’s idea, the person asked this question didn’t prepare before he asked.
First, I don’t think he even tried to solve the problem since he didn’t post any code there. I search in Google, and it’s easy to find the solution with example that someone wrote many years ago. Furthermore, he asked a wrong question. In fact, he needed to split a string not an array. 
</div>
<h3>Result  </h3>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
Some people didn’t help because he didn’t show his efforts.
</div>
<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
	Compared two cases above, even though both of them received correct answers finally, the person who ask the "smart way" learned more during the process he prepared the question.
