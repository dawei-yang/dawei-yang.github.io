<h2>Introduction  </h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
A coding standard includes naming conventions, formatting and indentation, classes and interfaces and so on [1].
It helps programmers to maintain their code. However, coding standard is not just a set of guidelines for programming 
language. It is also a tool that helps us learn programming language. In the rest of this essay, I will show the 
benefits of coding standards and  the ways coding standards help us learn programming languages.

<h2>Benefits of coding standards  </h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
	First of all, coding standards help people understand other people’s codes. The coding standards don’t make any sense
  to compilers because compilers only care the syntax. In fact, coding standards are developed for human beings. Following some standard, we can understand other people's codes or the codes we wrote long time ago. For example, I finished a programming assignment last semester. In order to save time, I just used x, y, z, i, j, k as variables. The program works, but if I want to reuse it again, I may need a while to understand what I had written.

<div style="text-indent:2em">	
  Nowadays, computer programmes are very big, so teamworks are very important. Coding standards can minimize the communication because we can read the codes easily under the same standards. For instance, when we see a function or a method has a prefix "On" such as "OnCollisionEnter" or "onButtonClick", we may notice that an event has been triggered.

<h2>Coding standards help us learn programming languages  </h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">  
After my first week of using ESLint, I found an advantage of ESLint is that it forces us to think or programming in a
efficient way. There are two simple recursive functions shown below. Both of them are working, but the second one receives an error from ESLint: “unnecessary ‘else’ after ‘return’ ”. 
  Some people may think it just an extra "else", and it is good as the algorithm and syntax are correct. However, I think it is not just
  extra "else". A recursive function needs recursion terminations, or it doesn't stop. Usually, we put the terminations at the beginning of the function. The error message from ESLint emphasizes the importance of terminations, and this kind of message can help us improve our programming skills.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">  
	Programming is similar to writing a book, while coding standards are similar to academic paper formatting such as MLA or IEEE.
