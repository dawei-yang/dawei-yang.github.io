<h2>Introduction  </h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
A coding standard includes naming conventions, formatting and indentation, classes and interfaces and so on [1].
It helps programmers to maintain their code. However, coding standard is not just a set of guidelines for programming 
language. It is also a tool that helps us learn programming language. In the rest of this essay, I will show the 
benefits of coding standards and  the ways coding standards help us learn programming languages.

<h2>Benefits of coding standards  </h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
	First of all, coding standards help people understand other people’s codes. The coding standards don’t make sense
  to compilers because compilers only care the syntax. In fact, coding standards are developed for human beings.
  Nowadays, computer programmes are very big, so teamworks are very important. Coding standards can minimize the communication.
	Coding standards also help people maintain the codes.

<h2>Coding standards help us learn programming languages  </h2>

After my first week of using ESLint, I found an advantage of ESLint is that it forces us to think or programming in a
efficient way. 

	Both recursive functions work, but the second one receives an error from ESLint: “unnecessary ‘else’ after ‘return’ ”. 
  Some people may think it just an extra else, and the algorithm and syntax are correct. However, I think it is not just
  extra else. In a recursive function,
